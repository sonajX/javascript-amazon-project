A final project created from watching JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024) by SuperSimplified Dev
This is a clone of Amazon. Albeit incomplete, it offers a comprehensive learning reference on how to make buttons interactive in a webpage and how to generate html to automate loading the products in

The project consists of JavaScript lessons from syntaxes to testing external libraries and frameworks using Jasmine.
This course also taught me how to use the JSON file format.
This course also features how to send and get a request/response to a back end server, from [supersimple](https://supersimplebackend.dev/) using the API.|
