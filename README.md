A final project created from watching JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024) by SuperSimplified Dev
This is a clone of Amazon. Albeit incomplete, it offers a comprehensive learning reference on how to make buttons interactive in a webpage.

The project consists of JavaScript lessons from syntaxes to testing external libraries and frameworks using Jasmine.
This course also features how to send and get a request/response to a back end server, from [supersimple](https://supersimplebackend.dev/) using the API.

I thank Simon @SuperSimpleDev for making this course absolutely free, you can also gwatch his other videos like putting a website in the internet and full HTML+CSS course for free
